# 2016 solutions

I completed the 2016 questions between 12/28-30 in 2022, having just finished the 2015
solutions.

General thoughts:

- Too many assembunny problems. 3 or 4 whole days' worth? Sheesh.
- Days 9 and 11 were difficult enough to send me to the spoiler threads. Day 11b I just
  needed to rewrite with tuples per gen/chip pair instead of sets per floor to make the
  equivalent-state pruning more efficient, but day 9b I probably wouldn't have solved
  without the algorithm laid out in the spoiler thread.
  - I'm very good at writing vanilla BFS/DFS loops and terrible at figuring out how to
    structure them in such a way that makes it easy to prune equivalent states.
- For next year's problems, I want to keep track of all the bugs I write in code I
  actively attempt to submit. I meant to for this year and completely forgot.
